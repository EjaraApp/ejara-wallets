# ejara-wallets
All Ejara single-currency wallets are designed to store, manage, transfer and receive cryptocurrency. Customers can also buy cryptocurrency using their mobile money accounts
Ejara does not store the private keys of our clients. The private key is stored in the mobile deviceâ€™s secure memory and deletes itself if the user logs out from the wallet. In order to secure the funds, a backup of the private key is necessary.
